Axioms and Theorems:

	Subset Axioms:
	For each formula __ not containing B, the following is an axiom:
	@t1 ... @tk @c [ 3B [ @x [ x in B <--> x in c & __ ] ] ]
		Definition:
		For any set tÂ­1, ..., tk and c, the subset B = {x in c | __ } is the set whose members are exactly those sets in c and __	

	Corollary 3C:
	@A, B [ 3D [ @t[ t in D <--> 3x, y [x in A & y in B & t = <x, y> ] ] ] ]
		Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
		For any set sets A, B,  {<x, y> | x in A & y in B}    is the set whose members are exactly the sets of the form <x, y> for some x in A & y in B
		Also known as the Cartesian Product A x B of the sets A and B!

	Relation:
		Definition:
		A relation R is a set of ordered pairs.
		@R [ R is a relation <--> @t [ t in R --> 3x, y[ t = <x, y> ] ] ]

	dom R: 
	@R [ 3D [ @x [ x in D <--> 3y [ <x, y> in R ] ] ] ]
		Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
		For any set sets R,  dom R  is the set whose members are those 1st-coordinate set of some ordered pair in R

	ran R: 
	@R [ 3D [ @x [ x in D <--> 3t [ <t, x> in R ] ] ] ]
		Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
		For any set sets R,  ran R  is the set whose members are those 2nd-coordinate set of some ordered pair in R
