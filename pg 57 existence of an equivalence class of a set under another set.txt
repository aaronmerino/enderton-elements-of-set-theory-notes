Axiom and Theorems:
	Subset Axioms:
	For each formula __ not containing B, the following is an axiom:
	@t1 ... @tk @c [ 3B [ @x [ x in B <--> x in c & __ ] ] ]
		Definition:
		For any set tÂ­1, ..., tk and c, the subset B = {x in c | __ } is the set whose members are exactly those sets in c and __	

  [MARIN]
  Subset Axiom (applied):
  @R, x [ @c [ 3D [ @t [ t in D <--> t in c & <x, t> in R ] ] ] ]     [Subset Axiom UI_META/'@R, x' UI_META/'<x, t> in R']

	ran R: 
		@R [ 3D [ @x [ x in D <--> 3t [ <t, x> in R ] ] ] ]
		Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
		For any set sets R,  ran R  is the set whose members are those 2nd-coordinate set of some ordered pair in R
