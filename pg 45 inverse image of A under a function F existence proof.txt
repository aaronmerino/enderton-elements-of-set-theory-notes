Axioms and Theorems:
	
	Subset Axioms:
	For each formula __ not containing B, the following is an axiom:
	@t1 ... @tk @c [ 3B [ @x [ x in B <--> x in c & __ ] ] ]
		Definition:
		For any set tÂ­1, ..., tk and c, the subset B = {x in c | __ } is the set whose members are exactly those sets in c and __	

	dom R: 
		@R [ 3D [ @x [ x in D <--> 3y [ <x, y> in R ] ] ] ]
		Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
		For any set sets R,  dom R  is the set whose members are those 1st-coordinate set of some ordered pair in R

	Function:
		Definition of F(x): (We define it like this for the purpose of making sure that F(x) is always defined for any F and x, but really its for semantic purposes)
		@F, x [ F(x) := U({y | <x, y> in F}) ]

		Definition:
		@F [F is a function <--> F is a relation & @x [ x in dom F --> 3_1y [ <x, y> in F ] ] ]

		**IGNORE** Definition of F(x) **THIS IS OLD VERSION**:
		@F [F is a function <--> F is a relation & @x [ x in dom F --> 3_1y->F(x)[ <x, F(x)> in F & @z [ <x, z> in F --> F(x) = z ] ] ] ]    
		

	Subset Axiom Applied (ID: APPLE):
	@F, A [ @c [ 3B [ @v [ v in B <--> v in c & F(v) in A ] ] ] ]					[Subset Axiom UI_META/"@F, A" UI_META/"F(v) in A"]

1. Show @F, A [ 3D [ @x [ x in D <--> x in dom F & F(x) in A ] ] ]
	2. let F, A be a set 

    D1. dom F is the set whose members are those 1st-coordinate set of some ordered pair in F       [dom R UI/F EI & Ext. Axiom]
        @x [ x in dom F <--> 3y [ <x, y> in F ] ]

	3. Show 3D [ @x [ x in D <--> x in dom F & F(x) in A ] ]
