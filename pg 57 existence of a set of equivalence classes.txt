Axiom and Theorems:
	Power Set Axiom:
	@a [ 3B [ @x [ x in B <--> @t [ t in x --> t in a ] ] ] ]
		Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
		For any set a, the power set  P(a) is the set whose members are exactly the subsets of a.
		[You can think of P(a) as a 1-ary operator. It refer to one set and one set only based on the sets a!]

	Subset Axioms:
	For each formula __ not containing B, the following is an axiom:
	@t1 ... @tk @c [ 3B [ @x [ x in B <--> x in c & __ ] ] ]
		Definition:
		For any set tÂ­1, ..., tk and c, the subset B = {x in c | __ } is the set whose members are exactly those sets in c and __	

	ran R: 
		@R [ 3D [ @x [ x in D <--> 3t [ <t, x> in R ] ] ] ]
		Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
		For any set sets R,  ran R  is the set whose members are those 2nd-coordinate set of some ordered pair in R

	Equivalence Relation on A:
		@R, A [ R is an equivalence relation on A <--> R is a binary relation on A & R is reflexive on A & R is symmetric & R is transitive ]

	Theorem 3M:
		Show @R [ R is a relation --> [ R is symmetric & R is transitive --> R is an equivalence relation on fld R ] ]	

	Equivalence Class of x (modulo R):
		@R, x [ 3D [ @t [ t in D <--> <x, t> in R ] ] ]
		Definition:
			For any set R, x, [x]_{R} is the set of sets t such that <x, t> in R.
			For any set R, x, and if R is an equivalence relation on the fld R, then [x]_{R} is called the equivalence class of x (modulo R).
