Axioms, Definitions, and Theorems:
	Subset Axioms:
		For each formula __ not containing B, the following is an axiom:
		@t1 ... @tk @c [ 3B [ @x [ x in B <--> x in c & __ ] ] ]
			Definition:
			For any set t­1, ..., tk and c, the subset B = {x in c | __ } is the set whose members are exactly those sets in c and __	

	Zero:
		0 := { }
		
	Definition of successor:
		@a [ a+ := a ∪ {a} ]
		notes:
			{a} can be constructed using Pairing Axiom (singleton)
			a ∪ {a} can be constructed using Union Axiom

	Definition of inductive:
		@A [ A is inductive <--> { } in A & @a [ a in A --> a+ in A ] ]

	Inifinity Axiom:
		3A [ A is inductive ]
		3A [ { } in A & @a [ a in A --> a+ in A ] ]

	Definition of a natural number:
		@b [ b is a natural number <--> @A [ A is inductive --> b in A ] ]

	Theorem 4A:
		3D [ @b [ b in D <--> b is a natural number ] ]
		Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
			ω is the set whose members are exactly the natural numbers 
			@b [ b in ω <--> b is a natural number ]

	Theorem 4B:
		ω is inductive & @A [ A is inductive & A != ω --> @t [ t in ω --> t in A ] ]

	Theorem 4C:
		@n [ n is a natural number & n != { } --> 3k [ k is a natural number & k+ = n ] ]

	Definition of Closed Under:
		@S, A [ S is a function & A ⊆ dom S --> [ A is closed under S <--> @x [ x in A --> S(x) in A ] ] ]

	Pg 70 closed under notes (this will help with definition of Peano System):
		@N, S [ S: N->N --> N is closed under S ]

	Definition of Peano System: ***
		@S, N, e [ <S, N, e> is a Peano System <--> [ 
									S: N->N & 				// this implies N is closed under S (as the above statement says)
									e in N & 					// so, N satisfies "e in N & @x [ x in N --> S(x) in N ]"

									~(e in ran S) &
									S is single-rooted &
									@A [ A ⊆ N --> [ e in A & @x [ x in A --> S(x) in A ] --> A = N ] ]			// this is so that N is the "smallest" such set satisfying "e in N & @x [ x in N --> S(x) in N ]"
									
									] 
						]

	Pg 71 existence of successor function that is restricted to ω:
		3D [ @t [ t in D <--> 3n [ n in ω & t = <n, n+> ] ] ]
		Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
			σ is called the successor function restricted to ω
			@t [ t in σ <--> 3n [ n in ω & t = <n, n+> ] ]

	Theorem 4D:
		<σ, ω, { }> is a Peano System

	Definition of transitive set (different from transitive relation which is a relation):
		@A [ A is a transitive set <--> @a [ a in A --> @x [ x in a --> x in A ] ] ]
