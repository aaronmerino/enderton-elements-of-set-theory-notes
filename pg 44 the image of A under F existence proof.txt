Axioms and Theorems:

	Subset Axioms:
	For each formula __ not containing B, the following is an axiom:
	@t1 ... @tk @c [ 3B [ @x [ x in B <--> x in c & __ ] ] ]
		Definition:
		For any set tÂ­1, ..., tk and c, the subset B = {x in c | __ } is the set whose members are exactly those sets in c and __	

	Relation:
		Definition:
		A relation R is a set of ordered pairs.
		@R [ R is a relation <--> @t [ t in R --> 3x, y[ t = <x, y> ] ] ]

	ran R: 
	@R [ 3D [ @x [ x in D <--> 3t [ <t, x> in R ] ] ] ]
		Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
		For any set sets R,  ran R  is the set whose members are those 2nd-coordinate set of some ordered pair in R

	Function:
		Definition of F(x): (We define it like this for the purpose of making sure that F(x) is always defined for any F and x, but really its for semantic purposes)
		@F, x [ F(x) := U({y | <x, y> in F}) ]

		Definition:
		@F [F is a function <--> F is a relation & @x [ x in dom F --> 3_1y [ <x, y> in F ] ] ]

		**IGNORE** Definition of F(x) **THIS IS OLD VERSION**:
		@F [F is a function <--> F is a relation & @x [ x in dom F --> 3_1y->F(x)[ <x, F(x)> in F & @z [ <x, z> in F --> F(x) = z ] ] ] ]
