Axioms, Definitions, and Theorems:
	Extensionality Axiom:
		@A, B [ @x [ x in A <--> x in B ] --> A = B ]

	Converse of Extensionality Axiom (Theorem Pg.2):
		@A, B [ A = B  --> @x [ x in A <--> x in B ]  ]

	Empty Set Axiom:
		3B [ @x [ ~(x in B) ] ]
		Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
		{ } is the set having no members
			[You can think of {} as a 0-ary operator. It refer to one set and one set only!]

	Pairing Axiom:
		@u, v [ 3B [ @x [ x in B <--> x = u or x = v ] ] ]
			Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
			For any sets u, v, the pair set {u, v} is the set whose only members are u and v.
			[You can think of {u, v} as a 2-ary operator. It refer to one set and one set only based on the sets u and v!]

			Definition:
			Let {x} := {x, x} is the set whose only members are x and x

	Union Axiom (Preliminary Form):
		@a, b [ 3B [ @x [ x in B <--> x in a or x in b ] ] ]
			Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
			For any sets a, b, the union a ∪ b is the set whose members are those sets belonging either to a or to b (or both).
			[You can think of a ∪ b as a 2-ary operator. It refer to one set and one set only based on the sets a and b!]


	Subset Axioms:
		For each formula __ not containing B, the following is an axiom:
		@t1 ... @tk @c [ 3B [ @x [ x in B <--> x in c & __ ] ] ]
			Definition:
			For any set t­1, ..., tk and c, the subset B = {x in c | __ } is the set whose members are exactly those sets in c and __	

		Example of a subset Axiom (relative complement):
			@A, B [ 3S [ @t [ t in S <--> t in A & ~(t in B) ] ] ]
				Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
				For any set A, B, the relative complement of B in A     A - B     is the set whose members are exactly those sets in A and but not in B
				[You can think of A - B as a 2-ary operator. It refer to one set and one set only based on the sets A and B!]


	dom R: 
		@R [ 3D [ @x [ x in D <--> 3y [ <x, y> in R ] ] ] ]
		Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
		For any set sets R,  dom R  is the set whose members are those 1st-coordinate set of some ordered pair in R

	ran R: 
		@R [ 3D [ @x [ x in D <--> 3t [ <t, x> in R ] ] ] ]
		Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
		For any set sets R,  ran R  is the set whose members are those 2nd-coordinate set of some ordered pair in R

	Function:
		Definition:
		@F [F is a function <--> F is a relation & @x [ x in dom F --> 3_1y [ <x, y> in F ] ] ]

	Pg 43 When F is a function and x the dom F, F(x) is y IFF <x, y> in F:
		@F, x [ F is a function & x in dom F -->  @w [ <x, w> in F <--> F(x) = w ] ]

	Definition of into:
		@F, A, B [ F maps A into B (F: A->B) <--> 
						F is a function &
						dom F = A &
						ran F ⊆ B 
					]

	Definition of single-rooted:
		@R [ R is single-rooted <--> 
				@y [ y in ran R --> 3_1x [ <x, y> in R ] ]
			]

Set of Natural Numbers Chapter:
	Zero:
		0 := { }

	Definition of successor:
		@a [ a+ := a ∪ {a} ]
		notes:
			{a} can be constructed using Pairing Axiom (singleton)
			a ∪ {a} can be constructed using Union Axiom

	Definition of inductive:
		@A [ A is inductive <--> { } in A & @a [ a in A --> a+ in A ] ]

	Definition of a natural number:
		@b [ b is a natural number <--> @A [ A is inductive --> b in A ] ]

	Theorem 4A:
		3D [ @b [ b in D <--> b is a natural number ] ]
		Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
			ω is the set whose members are exactly the natural numbers 
			@b [ b in ω <--> b is a natural number ]

	Theorem 4B:
		ω is inductive & @A [ A is inductive & A != ω --> @t [ t in ω --> t in A ] ]

	Theorem 4C:
		@n [ n is a natural number & n != { } --> 3k [ k is a natural number & k+ = n ] ]

	Definition of Closed Under:
		@S, A [ S is a function & A ⊆ dom S --> [ A is closed under S <--> @x [ x in A --> S(x) in A ] ] ]

	Pg 70 closed under notes (this will help with understanding definition of Peano System):
		@N, S [ S: N->N --> N is closed under S ]

	Definition of Peano System:
		@S, N, e [ <S, N, e> is a Peano System <--> [ 
									S: N->N & 				// this implies N is closed under S (as the above statement says)
									e in N & 					// so, N satisfies "e in N & @x [ x in N --> S(x) in N ]"

									~(e in ran S) &
									S is single-rooted &
									@A [ A ⊆ N --> [ e in A & @x [ x in A --> S(x) in A ] --> A = N ] ]			// this is so that N is the "smallest" such set satisfying "e in N & @x [ x in N --> S(x) in N ]"
									
									] 
						]

	Pg 71 existence of successor function that is restricted to ω:
		3D [ @t [ t in D <--> 3n [ n in ω & t = <n, n+> ] ] ]
		Definition (its uniqueness is always due to Ext. Axiom):
			σ is called the successor function restricted to ω
			@t [ t in σ <--> 3n [ n in ω & t = <n, n+> ] ]
