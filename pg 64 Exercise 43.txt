Axioms, Definitions, and Theorems:
	Definition of a binary (2-ary) relation on A:
		@A [ @D [ D is a binary relation on A <--> 
								@t [ t in D --> 3x, y [ x, y in A & t = <x, y> ] ] ] ] 

		note: D is a subset of A x A, so we can define it like this:
		@A [ @D [ D is a binary relation on A <--> 
								D âŠ† (A x A) ] ] 	

	Definition [FROM TEXTBOOK (my guess based on their proof of Theorem 3M)]:
		@R, A [ R is reflexive on A <--> @x [ x in A --> <x, x> in R ] ]
	
		@R [ R is symmetric <--> @x, y [ <x, y> in R --> <y, x> in R ] ]

		@R [ R is transitive <--> @x, y, z [ <x, y> in R & <y, z> in R --> <x, z> in R ] ]

	Definition of Trichotomy:
		@A, R [ R is a trichotomy on A <-->
							@x, y [ x, y in A -->
											(<x, y> in R & x != y & ~(<y, x> in R)) or

											(~(<x, y> in R) & x = y & ~(<y, x> in R)) or

											(~(<x, y> in R) & x != y & <y, x> in R)	
							 ]
					]

	Definition of Linear Ordering (AKA Total Ordering):
		@A, R [ R is a linear ordering on A <--> 
							R is a binary relation on A & 
							R is transitive &
							R is a trichotomy on A
					]

	Theorem 3R:
		@A, R [ R is a linear ordering on A --> 
									~3x [ <x, x> in R ] & 
									@x, y [ x, y in A & x != y --> <x, y> in R or <y, x> in R ]
							]

1. Show @R, A [ R is a linear ordering on A --> R^-1 is a linear ordering on A ]

	2. let R, A be sets

	3. Show R is a linear ordering on A --> R^-1 is a linear ordering on A

		4. R is a linear ordering on A		[ACD]

		5. @A, R [ R is a linear ordering on A <--> 
									R is a binary relation on A & 
									R is transitive &
									R is a trichotomy on A
							]		[Def. of linear ordering]

		6. R is a binary relation on A & 
				R is transitive &
				R is a trichotomy on A		[5 UI/A UI/R]
