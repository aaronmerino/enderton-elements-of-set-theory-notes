Axioms and Theorems:
	Extensionality Axiom:
	@A, B [ @x [ x in A <--> x in B ] --> A = B ]

	Lemma 3D: 
	@A, x, y [ <x, y> in A --> x in U(U(A)) & y in U(U(A)) ] 

	Subset Axioms:
	For each formula __ not containing B, the following is an axiom:
	@t1 ... @tk @c [ 3B [ @x [ x in B <--> x in c & __ ] ] ]
		Definition:
		For any set tÂ­1, ..., tk and c, the subset B = {x in c | __ } is the set whose members are exactly those sets in c and __	
	
	Union Axiom:
	@A [ 3B [ @x [ x in B <--> 3b [ b in A & x in b ] ] ] ]
		Definition:
		For any set A, the union of A  U(A)     is the set whose members are exactly the members of the members of A
		[You can think of U(A) as a 1-ary operator. It refer to one set and one set only based on the set A!]

	@A, x, y [ <x, y> in A --> x in U(U(A)) & y in U(U(A)) ]
