Note that for any set F, x, the set {y | <x, y> in F} exists because it is a subset of the set ran F.
We can use the subset axiom to build this set, and use ran F as c.

Axioms and Theorems:
	Subset Axioms:
	For each formula __ not containing D, the following is an axiom:
		@t1 ... @tk @c [ 3D [ @x [ x in D <--> x in c & __ ] ] ]
			Definition:
			For any set tÂ­1, ..., tk and c, the subset D = {x in c | __ } is the set whose members are exactly those sets in c and __	


	ran R: 
	@R [ 3D [ @x [ x in D <--> 3t [ <t, x> in R ] ] ] ]
		Definition:
		For any set sets R,  ran R  is the set whose members are those 2nd-coordinate set of some ordered pair in R
