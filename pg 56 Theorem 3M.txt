Axioms and Theorems:
	Definition of a binary (2-ary) relation on A:
		@A [ @D [ D is a binary relation on A <--> 
								@t [ t in D --> 3x, y [ x, y in A & t = <x, y> ] ] ] ] 
		note: D is a subset of A x A

	Definition:
		@R, A [ R is a relation --> 
						[ R is reflexive on A <--> @x [ x in A --> <x, x> in R ] ]
		]
	
		@R [ R is a relation --> 
					R is symmetric <--> @x, y [ <x, y> in R --> <y, x> in R ]
		]

		@R [ R is a relation --> 
					R is transitive <--> @x, y, z [ <x, y> in R & <y, z> in R --> <x, z> in R ]
		]

	Defintion:
		@R, A [ R is an equivalence relation on A <--> R is a binary relation on A & R is reflexive on A & R is symmetric & R is transitive ]


1. Show @R [ R is a relation --> [ R is symmetric & R is transitive --> R is an equivalence relation on fld R ] ]
